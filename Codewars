Given an array of one's and zero's convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

The code is used was this:

arr.join("").to_i(2) 

I will break it down (for my learning) 

join puts the arry/str into one continuious manor (as above) 0001 
(") means no spces
to_i makes this an integer
and (2) at the end  means binary system so it knows what you want to do.
