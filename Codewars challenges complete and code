Is n divisible by x and y?

Create a function isDivisible(n, x, y) that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. 
All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

my code to solve this challange 

def is_divisible(n,x,y)
  (n % x == 0) && (n % y == 0)
end

completes the challange but on a side note 
(make sure when looking at divisable by you use The modulus operator to return remainder after dividing two integers). 
That is, 9 % 4 = 1
